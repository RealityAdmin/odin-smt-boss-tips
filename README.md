# odin-smt-boss-tips
A project to practice HTML as part of my learning from The Odin Project. Except instead of recipes I'm doing tips on bosses from Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey. Because that makes me more invested in this project.

In particular, this project is the barebones HTML; tags, absolute and relative links, as well as images. And some more practice with Git.
