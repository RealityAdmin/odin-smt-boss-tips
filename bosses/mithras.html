        <h1>Mithras</h1>
        <img src="mithras.webp">
        <p>Mithras (Level 19) is the boss of Sector Bootes, and 
            a big step up from Morax; without the right prep, he 
            can and <em>will</em> wreck you. With the right prep however,
            he;s not too bad.
        </p>
        <h2>Tips to Prepare:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                The main character's equipment is as always of 
                utmost importance. Get the materials to make the 
                Alabaser gun: its Wind Shot hits Mithras' Wind
                weakness. More importantly however, take the time to
                grind for DF Bootite II, and get UMA skins using Enemy Search to get the 
                Green Vest. The Ice resistance will be VERY important.
            </li>
            <li>
                Get demons that can first resist/null Ice, and then after
                can hit Wind. A healer may be nice; but also get a few buff or debuff
                users, because buffs can be a big lifesaver. You can fuse Jack Frost;
                but not for the reasons you may think; he absorbs Ice, meaning
                he's essentially safe against Mithras' worst attack. Also meat shield.
            </li>
            <li>
                It would also be very helpful to stock on Revival Beads; this boss has 
                an instakill attack. Also get some Dis-Strain; the boss can inflict it and 
                MP restoring items are VERY rare at this time.
            </li>
            <li>
                Most importantly; have at least 1 backup demon for if a demon dies
                and you can't take the 2 turns to revive and resummon them. Otherwise,
                that 1 turn may go very bad.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The Fight</h2>
        <p>Mithras himself resists Gun, and nulls Ice, Light and Dark. He has
            no real pattern, so just keep prepared for any of the following attacks:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Rampage:</strong> 2-4 light hits to random targets
                of your party. Decently strong, but just heal if need be.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Waking Dream:</strong> A party-wide physical attack that
                can cause Strain; it's basically Poison but for your MP. This is where
                the Dis-Strains come in handy; given that you want as much MP for Wind
                and buffs/debuffs to finish this fight smoothly.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Light Of Order:</strong> Yes, a Chaos-aligned demon
                has an attack with "Order" in it's name, don't ask me why. One of
                the first troublesome attacks that Mithras has; it's an Almighty instakill
                that targets the demon with the lowest Magic stat. This can be bad, especially
                if your main damage dealer gets killed by this. Fortunately it never
                targets the player, so have a backup demon ready, or revive and resummon;
                the attack is 100% accurate, so you just have to deal with it.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Mabufudyne:</strong> Yep, Mithras has a top tier 
                elemental spell at this point in the game. Fortunately, he doesn't
                have the magic stat to go with it, clocking at 21. So if you bring
                demons and wear equipment that at least resist Ice, it's basically
                harmless. If not, this attack will hit HARD.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>As far as I know, Mithras has no real pattern. That being said if you're prepared like above,
            the only attack to really worry about is Light of Order. Debuff him to soften him up,
            keep hitting him with Wind, and this mad scientist will have a 100% chance of death.
