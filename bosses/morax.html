        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Morax (Lvl 10) is the boss of Sector Antila, the first sector,
            and the first major boss in the game. Even though this
            <em>is</em> an Atlus game, as long as you do some basic 
            prep and exploit his weakness to ice, you'll butcher 
            this overgrown cow.
        </p>
        <h2>Tips to Prepare</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In terms of equipment, I'd recommend getting the 
                forma needed to craft the Andersen; it's random targetting
                won't matter as much since there's only a single target.
                But more importantly, it has Ice Shot, which gives the main
                character a way to do extra damage to Morax and trigger
                Co-Op attacks, makign the fight go faster.
            </li>
            <li>
                Also make the Ancient Vest; it may give weakness to Gun,
                but the resistance to fire is more important; going in with
                the starting vest means you're weak to Fire and thus at greater risk
                of death, followed by Game Over.
            </li>
            <li>
                Similarly, for your party get/fuse demons that can attack with ice
                while also being resistant to fire. I fused a Pele and then used
                D-Sources to give her Bufu. Also have a demon with some debuff
                like Tarunda or Rakunda, will make the fight smoother. Also if you
                can, get a demon that has the same alignment and Ice attacks for 
                more Co-Op attack goodness.
            </li>
            <li>
                Finally, make sure you craft some Patra and Me Patra Stones if you can.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>The Fight</h2>
        Morax resists Gun, reflects Fire, and is weak to Ice. He's got
        some good physical and magic attacks, and a good strength
        and magic stat, but with the right prep it's nothing too worrisome:
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Maragi:</strong> Light fire attack that hits the entire party.
                It's his most used attack; hence the need for Fire resistance.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Gehenna:</strong> Tries to inflict Fear on each member of the party.
                Fear is annoying because demons may unsummon themselves; use Patra Stones
                and Me Patra stones and you'll be good.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Lunge:</strong> Light physical attack. Nothing special.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Horned Rampage:</strong> 2 hits of light physical attacks
                on random targets, each hit has a chance to inflict Fear. He'll start
                using this move when low on health; but it's not that big of a deal;
                heal if you need, patra stones if anyone has fear, etc.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p> Overall, keep hitting him with Ice attacks, heal if need be,
            and get a few debuffs on him to make the fight go faster. Nothing much to
            it.
